%h1 There are no RailsBridge employees.
%p
  RailsBridge is an <em>extremely</em> non-hierarchical organization, full of people
  who want to make tech better and are willing to donate their time and resources to 
  that effort. From 2009 to 2013, RailsBridge's three-person board comprised Sarah Mei 
  and Sarah Allen, co-founders, and Austin Putman, treasurer. Now, RailsBridge (and 
  its umbrella organization, Bridge Foundry), is project of 
  #{ link_to "School Factory", "http://schoolfactory.org/" }, which gives us 501(c)3 
  status, but with all the autonomy we need.

%h2 A few of the people who have helped RailsBridge exist:
