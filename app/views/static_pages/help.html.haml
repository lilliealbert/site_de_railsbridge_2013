%h1 Helping people learn to program is an amazing experience.

%p The most visible volunteer positions within RailsBridge are the workshop sponsors, organizers, teachers, and TAs. They make each workshop happen!

  %h4 Want to teach?
  %p Yay! Head over to the #{link_to "upcoming workshops page", :events} to see if one is coming up near you. If not, get in touch with your #{link_to "local chapter", :chapters} (or start one if it doesn't exist).

  %h4 Want to organize?
  %p Fantastic. Read through the #{link_to "organizing page", :organize} and #{link_to "fill out our short interest form", :interest_form}!

  %h4 Want to host or sponsor?
  %p That's awesome. Check out our #{ link_to "information for hosts", :host } and #{ link_to "Donor FAQ", :donor_faq }.
